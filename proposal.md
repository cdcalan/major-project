# Major Project Proposal, By: Alina Sami
I will create a version of a Mario / Poptropica style game, where the goal is for a player to navigate an environment like Mario, hunting for coins/treasure while avoiding enemies and obstacles. Some enemies are more difficult to kill than others, but are also 'power ups' scattered thoughout that can help win the game. The player wins when the amount of coins required by the quest are collected. Otherwise, the round ends if the player loses all its life counters, or when the timer runs out.

I chose this project because I have always been interested in creating this type of game, and I think that it is fitting for the timespan we have to complete it:

- May 4:  Complete start and end screens, scrolling background, counters, timer, and classes of each sprite.  
- May 11: Complete Game environment. 
- May 18: Gravity, and collision detection. 
- May 25: Finish sprite interaction.
- June 1: Finish adding details. Implement level-ups and other items from Nice-to-Have List.   
- June 8: Have a working version of the game.

## Need to Have List
 - Start-screen with start button, game description/ instructions. 
 - End-screen or info-box that displays player score. 
 - Scrolling game-screen. 
 - Background image (scrolls with the game screen). 
 - Environment/ terrain, such as ground, water, platforms/ pipes (scrolls with the game screen).
 - Interactive Character Sprites (including tortoises, crabs, and fighterflies). No slipices will be used in this game. 
 - Interactive Object Sprites, such as coins, special boxes/ power ups.
 - A Mario/Player character that has key-controlled movements (ex: forward, backward, jump, kick).
 - Implement gravity as part of jumping, or falling after collisions. 
 - Collision detection (to detect whether coins or boosters have been picked up, or whether player has bumped into dangerous sprites, or failed to avoid obstacles). 
 - Multiple counters to keep track of different objects picked up by player during the game. Counters add when more similar objects are gained, and subtract when they are used. Include a points counter. 
 - Player-"Life" counter that adds/subtracts the number of lives the player has according to player-performance. 
 - Enemy-Life counter (specific to each different type of enemy) that subtracts the number of lives the enemy sprite has according to the number of blows it receives from Player. 
 - 'Animate' player avatar by changing its image according to whether its running, jumping, flying, etc.
 - A timer (displayed on-screen) that counts down the time left in the round. 
 
## Nice to Have List
 - Sound effects (for gaining coins, collisions, etc.)
 - Better graphics, such as changing player avatar as more powerups are collected. 
 - Save highscores and compare player score with highscores at the end of the game. 
 - Mini games player has to play if clicked or bumped into special objects.
 - Levels that get progressively more difficult (such as: more obstacles, stronger / faster enemy sprites, etc.). 
 - Generate fireballs whenever the player takes extended time to complete a level.
 - When temperature drops, add deadly icicles.
