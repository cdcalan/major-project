# Major Project Proposal, By: Alina Sami
I will create a Mario / Poptropica style game, where player has to go through an environment like Mario, picking up coins and avoiding/defeating enemies. 

## Need to Have List
 - Start-screen with start button, game description/ instructions. 
 - Game-Over info box / screen that displays 'player score'. 
 - Scrolling game-screen. 
 - Background image (scrolls with the game screen). 
 - Environment/ terrain, such as ground, water, cliffs, 'shelves' (scrolls with the game screen).
 - Interactive Character Sprites, including helpful characters, and dangerous characters to avoid.
 - Interactive Object Sprites, such as coins, special boxes, power ups.
 - Mario/Player character that has key controlled movements (ex: forward, backward, jump).
 - Implement gravity as part of jumping, or falling after collisions. 
 - Collision detection (to detect wether coins or boxes containing boosters have been picked up, or whether player has bumped into dangerous sprites, or failed to avoid obstacles). 
 - Multiple counters to keep track of different objects picked up by player during the game. Counters add when more similar objects are gained, and subtract when they are used. 
 - "Life" counter that adds/subtracts the number of lives the player has according to player-performance. 
 - 'Animate' player avatar by changing its image according to whether its running, jumping, flying, etc.
 
## Nice to Have List
 - Sound effects (for gaining coins, collisions, etc.)
 - Better graphics
 - Change player avatar as more powerups are collected. 
 - Save highscores and compare player score with highscores at the end of the game. 
 - Mini games player has to play if clicked or bumped into special objects.
 - Level ups that get progressively more difficult (such as: more obstacles, stronger / faster enemy sprites, etc.).
